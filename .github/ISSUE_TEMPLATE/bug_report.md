The Serilog maintainers want you to have a great experience using Serilog, and will happily track down and resolve bugs. We all have limited time, though, so please think through all of the factors that might be involved and include as much useful information as possible 😊.

ℹ If the problem is caused by a sink or other extension package, please track down the correct repository for that package and create the report there: this tracker is for the core **Serilog** package only.

**Description**

**Reproduction**

**Expected behavior**
A concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Relevant package, tooling and runtime versions**

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
